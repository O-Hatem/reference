ctrl+L 							# clears terminal
ctrl+U 							# clears line
alt+.							# walk through previous commands

alt+~							# changes between windows of the same program
alt+esc 						# changes between windows and displays them

super+d 						# shows desktop
super+a 						# shows activities
super+m 						#toggole notification tray

q # quit
j # one line up
k # one line down
g # first line
G # last line
/pattern # search for the pattern forward in the file
?pattern # search for the pattern forward in the file
n # repeat last search
N  # repeat last search in the opposite direction

zip zipname file1 file2 fileN folder1 folder2 folderN # zipname is the file name after being ziped
unzip zipname							# unzip .zip files
unzip zipname -d dirname 				# unzip to a directory
